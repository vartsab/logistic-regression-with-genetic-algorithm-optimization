# Project: From Clusters to Perfection â€“ Optimizing Machine Learning Models for Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on building and optimizing machine learning models to classify malignant and benign tumors in the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin" dataset. Using clustering methods, logistic regression, and advanced optimization techniques like gradient descent and genetic algorithms, the project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to achieving near-perfect classification accuracy.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Standardized features and analyzed the dataset for class balance and feature importance.
- Clustering Techniques:
 - Spectral Clustering, K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
 - Evaluated performance using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and confusion matrices.
- Dimensionality Reduction:
 - Applied PCA for feature visualization and dimensionality reduction.
- Classification Models:
 - Logistic Regression: Baseline model with 98% accuracy and F1 score of 0.99.
 - Gradient Descent Optimization: Improved balance with 95% accuracy and F1 score of 0.96.
 - Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Near-perfect results with 99% accuracy and an F1 score of 1.0.
- Evaluation Metrics:
 - Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrices, and ARI for clustering methods.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
 - scikit-learn (models, clustering, and evaluation)
 - pandas, numpy (data preprocessing)
 - matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## Results
- Successfully optimized classification models to achieve 99% accuracy and an F1 score of 1.0 using genetic algorithms.
- Demonstrated clear advantages of parameter optimization in medical data classification.
